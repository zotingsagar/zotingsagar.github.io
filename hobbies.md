I started writing short stories a few years back but never posted them anywhere. Now I have created a webpage, which I will post here soon. When I came to the IIT campus, I learned how to cycle. Now, I like to go for morning rides on the beautiful campus. I also learned to swim and play snooker on campus. When the pandemic began, all outdoor activity stopped. I got a chance to work on the artistic side. I design 3D objects on the blender software whenever I have free time. Below is one of the small project on blender...BatMobile.
