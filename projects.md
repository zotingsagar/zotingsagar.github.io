<h1> Major Projects and Seminar </h1> 





**1. Master's Thesis: Design of Pipeline ADC based on Ring Amplifier** (*June'21-June'22*) 


The 8 bit pipeline ADC is designed using 1.5-bit per stage. Conventionally, OPAMP is used to design interstage residue amplifier, but in this project ring amplifier is used. Ring amplifier is fairly new concept which is designed using cascading inverters.

**2. Seminar: Study of Low Power Analog Circuits for Machine Learning Applications** (*Jan'21-May'22*) 

Different classifier analog circuits are reviewed.[[Report]](EE694_203070064_Seminar_Report.pdf)


**3. BE Final Year Project: Design Optimization, Simulation and Analysis of the Micro-TCD Gas Sensor** (*Aug'18-May'19*) 

Micro-bridge gas  sensor modelled and simulated for maximum temperature change.[[report]](BE_Project_Report.pdf)


<h1> Course Projects </h1> 


**1. Mixed Signal VLSI Design: Current Steering Digital-to-Analog Converter Design (Binary and Segmented DAC)** (*SEM2*)  

8-bit current steering Binary and Segmented DAC is designed for the course mixed-signal vlsi design. Both the Binary and Segmented DAC is compared.

**2. CMOS Analog VLSI Design: Operational Amplifier Design** (*SEM1*)   

In this course project, OPAMP is designed with the help instructor's guidelinece. This is rail-to-rail, two folded cascode stage OPAMP with Class-AB output stage.
