<h1> Major Projects </h1> 





**1. Master's Thesis: Design of Pipeline ADC based on Ring Amplifier** 


The 8 bit pipeline ADC is designed using 1.5-bit per stage. Conventionally, OPAMP is used to design interstage residue amplifier, but in this project ring amplifier is used. Ring amplifier is fairly new concept which is designed using cascading inverters.

**2. Mixed Signal VLSI Design: Current Steering Digital-to-Analog Converter Design (Binary and Segmented DAC)** 

8-bit current steering Binary and Segmented DAC is designed for the course mixed-signal vlsi design. Both the Binary and Segmented DAC is compared.
